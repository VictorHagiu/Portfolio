👋 Welcome to my GitHub portfolio!

I'm passionate about quality assurance and automation, and currently, my focus is on Cypress, a powerful end-to-end testing framework for web applications. In addition to my expertise in Cypress, I have also gained skills in JavaScript projects and API testing, especially with Postman, CI/CD integration with Jenkins, Rest Assured API, Newman, and CLI integrations.

In this repository, you'll find a collection of projects showcasing my expertise in Cypress automation and my proficiency in API testing. From simple test scripts to complex test suites, I'm constantly refining my skills to ensure robust, reliable, and efficient automated testing solutions.

🚀 Dive into the code, explore the test cases, and witness firsthand how these tools can streamline your testing processes and elevate the quality of your web applications.

🔍 Stay tuned as I continue to expand my portfolio with new projects and explore other technologies in the realm of software testing and quality assurance.
